// ================================= OOP PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS
    //Objects are simply a way of representing state and behavior. To practice writing objects,
    // it helps in the beginning to write objects that represent tangable things like animals,
    // people, cars, etc. With that in mind, until you can write a class quickly and create objects
    // from it, choose a real world concept and do the following...

    //  1. add three instance variables set to private of at least two primative types
    //  2. add 2 instance methods that effect one or more instance variables
    //  3. add 1 static constant that makes sense for the given class
    //  4. add 1 static method that makes sense for the given class
    //  5. add an empty constructor and a constructor that sets all instance variables
    //  6. add getters and setters for all instance variables
    //  7. add main method to create the objects

    //Here are some class suggestions:
    //  User
    //  Product
    //  Comment
    //  Post
    //  Car
    //  Pet
    //  Radio
    //  SodaCan
    //  Table
    //  Remote
    //  Building
    //  Toy
    //  Food
    //  Animal
    //  Location
